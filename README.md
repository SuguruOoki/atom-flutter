## Status - discontinued

Flutter previously offered two editor plugins - one for Atom and one for IntelliJ. Late
2016 we consolidated our editor engineering teams to work on a single plugin: IntelliJ.

The Atom plugin has survived long with little maintenance, but weâ€™re now starting to make
larger changes to the flutter tools editor protocol and do not expect to be able to keep
Atom updated.

We have moved the flutter-atom plugin out of the flutter repository to a new home, however
without a new owner we intend to de-list the existing plugin from the Atom store.

Note: Dart support in Atom has long been successfully community-maintained, and after this
change you can still use Atom to write Flutter applications. However the `Run` button, device
selector and ability to automatically connect to the debugger on a mobile phone will go away.

All of this functionality is of course still available through the flutter command line tool,
or through IntelliJ.
