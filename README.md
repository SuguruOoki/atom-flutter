[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/atom-flutter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/flutter/atom-flutter)

A Flutter development environment for Atom.

## Under Construction

This plugin is not yet available for use; we're investigating using Dart's new
DDC compiler to build plugins for Atom.

For info about the existing Dart plugin for Atom, see the
[dartlang](https://github.com/dart-atom/dartlang) plugin.
